# project-Etch-A-Sketch-final

In this project, I’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project is not easy for me. I’ll probably have to Google frequently to get the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use. I'll be building this using the tools that I have already learned, and there are plenty of resources on the internet for learning stuff that the course haven’t covered yet if I decide I need it. The instructions of the project will walk me through the basic steps, and I'll implement them.
